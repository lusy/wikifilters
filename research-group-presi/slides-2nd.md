## Overview

* Motivation
* State of the literature/Literature: What does the scientific community know
* Documentation: What is an edit filter and why was it introduced according to Wikipedia's/MediaWiki pages?
* Data Analysis: Edit filters on English Wikipedia
* Open questions

---

# Motivation

* What is the role of filters among existing (algorithmic) quality-control mechanisms (bots, semi-automated tools, ORES, humans)?  Which type of tasks do filters take over? 
* How have these tasks evolved over time (are they changes in the type, number, etc.)?
* What are suitable areas of application for rule-based systems such as filters in contrast to the other ML-based approaches?

---

## State of the Literature

<img src="images/funnel-diagramm-no-filters.JPG" alt="Funnel diagramm of all vandal fighting mechanisms (no filters)">

* One thing is ostentatiously missing: edit filters

---

## What is an edit filter

* MediaWiki extension
* regex based filtering of edits and other actions (e.g. account creation, page deletion or move, upload)
* triggers *before* an edit is published
* different actions can be defined

---

## Motivations for its introduction

* disallow certain types of obvious pervasive (perhaps automated) vandalism directly
* takes more than a single click to revert
* human editors can use their time more productively elsewhere

---

## Edit filters in the quality control mechanisms frame

* the question of infrastructure
* guidelines say: for in-depth checks and problems with a particular article bots are better (don't use up resources)
* they were introduced before the ml tools came around.
* they probably work, so no one sees a reason to shut them down

---

* hypothesis: Wikipedia is a diy project driven by volunteers; they work on whatever they like to work
* hypothesis: it is easier to understand what's going on than it is with a ML tool. people like to use them for simplicity and transparency reasons
* hypothesis: it is easier to set up a filter than program a bot. Setting up a filter requires "only" understanding of regular expressions. Programming a bot requires knowledge of a programming language and understanding of the API.

## What do most active filters do?

    135  repeating characters & tag, warn
    30   "large deletion from article by new editors" & tag, warn
    61   "new user removing references" & tag
    18   "test type edits from clicking on edit bar" & deleted in Feb 2012
    3    "new user blanking articles" & tag, warn

## Manual classification

*vandalism*, *good faith* and *maintenance*

* difficult to distinguish
* a lot of subcategories

---

## Current Limitations

* Only EN Wikipedia
* manual filter classification only conducted by me

---

## Bigger picture: Upload filters
