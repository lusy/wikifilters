* Signpost/Intro
* overview over the presi so people can follow more easily
* Motivation: why do we want to study this: confluence questions
* funnel diagramm without filters: explain state of scientific literature on it
* key findings (high level)
* data analysis: what of this is really relevant

## Overview

* Motivation
* State of the literature/Literature: What does the scientific community know
* What is an edit filter and why was it introduced?/Documentation: What is an edit filter and why was it introduced according to Wikipedia's/MediaWiki pages?
* Data Analysis: Edit filters on English Wikipedia
* Open questions

# Motivation

What are edit filters?
Why are there edit filters?
What task(s) do they take care of?
How are they different from other existing mechanisms?
What is their role in Wikipedia's complex socio-technical system?

  Q1 We wanted to improve our understanding of the role of filters in existing algorithmic quality-control mechanisms (bots, ORES, humans).
  Q2 Which type of tasks do these filters take over in comparison to the other mechanisms? How these tasks evolve over time (are they changes in the type, number, etc.)?
  Q3 Since filters are classical rule-based systems, what are suitable areas of application for such rule-based system in contrast to the other ML-based approaches.

> "The edit filter is a tool that allows editors in the *edit filter manager* group to set controls mainly to address common patterns of harmful editing."

## Motivations for introducing the abuse filter extention

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Edit_filter/Archive_1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Edit_filter/Archive_1):

* disallow certain types of obvious pervasive (perhaps automated) vandalism directly
* takes more than a single click to revert
* human editors can use their time more productively elsewhere

---

## Collaboration bots-filters

* MrZ Bot puts editors found on the abuse log often on the AIV noticeboard
* "There is a bot reporting users tripping certain filters at WP:AIV and WP:UAA; you can specify the filters here:" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DatBot/filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DatBot/filters)

## Manual classification

*vandalism*, *good faith* and *maintenance*

---

# Next steps for finishing the thesis

* abuse_filter_history table (open MR, ping Aaron)

---

# Beyond the thesis

* What are the differences between how filters are governed on EN Wikipedia compared to other language versions?
* Are there filters targetting harassment?
* Ethnographic analysis (e.g. IVs with edit filter managers/admins/users whose edits have been disallowed would be really interesting)
* (how) has the notion of "vandalism" on Wikipedia evolved over time (when looking at the regex patterns)

---

* Precision/Recall: False Positives? were filters shut down, bc they matched more False positives than they had real value?
* What can we filter with a REGEX? And what not? Are regexes the suitable technology for the means the community is trying to achieve?

---

# Current Limitations

* Only EN Wikipedia
* manual filter classification only conducted by me

---
