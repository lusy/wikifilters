# Motivation

What are edit filters?
Why are there edit filters?
What task(s) do they take care of?
How are they different from other existing mechanisms?

# Fighting vandalism on Wikipedia

Literature review:

bots, semi-automated tools, ores, humans

---

## Bots

* 1st line of defence
* fastest revert time
* ClueBot NG, ...

---

## Semi-automated tools

* Huggle, Twinkle, STiki, ..

---

## ORES

* can be used by bots or semi-automated tools

---

## Humans

* watchlists
* manual reverts of chance discoveries

Summary:

# Data

* wikipedia's pages (policies, guidelines, etc.), most prominently: ...
* abuse filter extention tables

## State of the Art on EN Wikipedia

Data analysis

---

# Next steps for finishing the thesis

* abuse_filter_history table (ping Aaron)


---

# Beyond the thesis

* What are the differences between how filters are governed on EN Wikipedia compared to other language versions?
* Are there filters targetting harassment?
* Ethnographic analysis (e.g. IVs with edit filter managers/admins/users whose edits have been disallowed would be really interesting)
* (how) has the notion of "vandalism" on Wikipedia evolved over time (when looking at the regex patterns)
* Precision/Recall: False Positives? were filters shut down, bc they matched more False positives than they had real value?
* Do filters work the desired way/help for a smoother Wikipedia service or is it a lot of work to maintain them and the usefulness is questionable?
* What can we filter with a REGEX? And what not? Are regexes the suitable technology for the means the community is trying to achieve?

---

# Current Limitations

* Only EN Wikipedia
* manual filter classification only conducted by me

# Bigger picture: Upload filters
