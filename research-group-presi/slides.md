## Edit filter, an example

<img src="images/Screenshot-trigger-disallow.png" height="500" alt="screenshot-filter-disallow-message">

---

# Motivation

What are edit filters?
Why are there edit filters?
What task(s) do they take care of?
How are they different from other existing mechanisms?

---

> "The edit filter is a tool that allows editors in the *edit filter manager* group to set controls mainly to address common patterns of harmful editing."

<small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter)</small>

---

# Structure

(of the presi? or of the thesis?)

---

# Vandalism on Wikipedia

---

Def:

> "On Wikipedia, vandalism has a very specific meaning: editing (or other behavior) deliberately intended to obstruct or defeat the project's purpose, which is to create a free encyclopedia, in a variety of languages, presenting the sum of all human knowledge."

<small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism)</small>

# Fighting vandalism on Wikipedia

---

Literature review:

bots, semi-automated tools, ores, humans

---

## Important to study algorithmic mechamisms

* increased relative share of edits
* difference not only of scale but of substance
* intransparency and gatekeeping

---

## Bots

* 1st line of defence
* fastest revert time
* ClueBot NG, ...

---

## Semi-automated tools

* Huggle, Twinkle, STiki, ..

---

## ORES

* can be used by bots or semi-automated tools

---

## Humans

* watchlists
* manual reverts of chance discoveries

---

Summary:
funnel diagram (without filters)
One thing is ostentatiously missing: edit filters

---

(# Methods)

---

# Data

* wikipedia's pages (policies, guidelines, etc.), most prominently: ...
* abuse filter extention tables

---

# Descriptive Overview. What is an edit filter?

---

<img src="images/detailed-page-filter249.png" alt="Details page of Filter #249">

---

## MediaWiki Extension

* permissions
* tables: *abuse_filter*, *abuse_filter_log*, *abuse_filter_action* and *abuse_filter_history*
* actions filters trigger: logging, warning, throttling, disallowing, revoking auto-promoted groups, blocking, removing from privileged groups, range-blocking, tagging
* smth else?

---

## Introducing a new filter

For everybody:

* checklist: is an edit filter the suitable solution
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Filters are applied to all edits. Therefore, problematic changes that apply to a single page are likely not suitable for an edit filter."
    \item filters, after adding up, make editing slower
    \item in depth checks should be done by a separate software that users run on their own machines
    \item no trivial errors should be catched by filters (ala style guidelines)
    \item there are Titles Blacklist and Link/Spam Blacklist which should be used if the issue at hand has to do with a problematic title or link.
\end{itemize}
* request at: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/Requested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/Requested)

For edit filter managers:

* read the docs
* run tests
* Generally, always set action to logging only first
* Announce at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter_noticeboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter_noticeboard) and receive feedback
* possibly change the filter action

---

## Who can edit filters

* *abusefilter-modify* permission
* March 9, 2019: 152 users in the *edit filter managers* group (and 1181 admins)
* (4 users on CA Wikipedia, and the role doesn't exist on the DE, ES, RU or BG wiki)

---

## How are problems handled

Edit Filter Noticeboard:

* current filters behaviour: e.g. changing filter action or updating pattern
* users rights discussions

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/False_positives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/False_positives):

* monitored by edit filter managers
* update filters
* help good faith users
* discourage malicious edits

Personal security best practices for edit filter managers

## Motivations for introducing the abuse filter extention

Quote from EditFilter discussion archive

---

Also from the archive:
abuse filter -> edit filter

---

## Collaboration bots-filters

"There is a bot reporting users tripping certain filters at WP:AIV and WP:UAA; you can specify the filters here."
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DatBot/filters}

* consider collaborations filters/bots (e.g. MrZ Bot which puts editors found on the abuse log often on the AIV noticeboard.) are there further exampled for this kind of collaborations?

## What do most active filters do?

\begin{table*}
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r p{10cm} p{5cm} }
    % \toprule
    Filter ID & Publicly available description & Actions \\
    \hline
      135 & repeating characters & tag, warn \\
      30 & "large deletion from article by new editors" & tag, warn \\
      61 & "new user removing references" ("new user" is handled by "!("confirmed" in user\_groups)") & tag \\
      18 & "test type edits from clicking on edit bar" (people don't replace Example texts when click-editing) & deleted in Feb 2012 \\
      3 & "new user blanking articles" & tag, warn \\
      172 & "section blanking" & tag \\
      50 & "shouting" (contribution consists of all caps, numbers and punctuation) & tag, warn \\
      98 & "creating very short new article" & tag \\
      65 & "excessive whitespace" (note: "associated with ascii art and some types of vandalism") & deleted in Jan 2010 \\
      132 & "removal of all categories" & tag, warn \\
      225 & "vandalism in all caps" (difference to 50? seems to be swear words, but shouldn't they be catched by 50 anyway?) & disallow \\
      189 & "BLP vandalism or libel" & tag \\
      402 & "new article without references" & deleted in Apr 2013, before that disabled with comment "disabling, no real use" \\
      384 & "addition of bad words or other vandalism" (seems to be a blacklist) & disallow \\
      432 & "starting new line with lower case letters" & tag, warn //I recall there was a rule of thumb recommending not to user filters for style things? although that's not really style, but rather wrong grammar.. \\
      380 & hidden; public comment "multiple obscenities" & disallow \\
      351 & "text added after categories and interwiki" & tag, warn \\
      279 & "repeated attempts to vandalise" & tag, throttle (triggered when someone hits "edit" repeatedly in a short ammount of time) \\
      491 & "edits ending with emoticons or !" & tag, warn \\
      636 & "unexplained removal of sourced content" & warn (that, together with 634 and 635 refutes my theory that warn always goes together with tag) \\
      231 & "long string of characters containing no spaces" (that's surely english though^^) & tag, warn \\
      650 & "creation of a new article without any categories" & (log only) \\
      527 & hidden; public comments "T34234: log/throttle possible sleeper account creations" & throttle \\
      633 & "possible canned edit summary" (apparently pre-filled on mobile though) & tag \\
      686 & "IP adding possible unreferenced material to BLP" (BLP= biography of living people? I thought, it was forbidden to edit them without a registered account) & (log only) \\
      712 & "possibly changing date of birth in infobox" ("possibly"? and I thought infoboxes were pre-generated from wikidata?) & (log only) \\
      833 & "newer user possibly adding a unreferenced or improperly referenced material" & (log only) \\

* all admins can view hidden filters
* mailinglist for discussing private filters

# Next steps for finishing the thesis

* abuse_filter_history table (ping Aaron)


---

# Beyond the thesis

* What are the differences between how filters are governed on EN Wikipedia compared to other language versions?
* Are there filters targetting harassment?
* Ethnographic analysis (e.g. IVs with edit filter managers/admins/users whose edits have been disallowed would be really interesting)
* (how) has the notion of "vandalism" on Wikipedia evolved over time (when looking at the regex patterns)
* Precision/Recall: False Positives? were filters shut down, bc they matched more False positives than they had real value?
* Do filters work the desired way/help for a smoother Wikipedia service or is it a lot of work to maintain them and the usefulness is questionable?
* What can we filter with a REGEX? And what not? Are regexes the suitable technology for the means the community is trying to achieve?

---

# Current Limitations

* Only EN Wikipedia
* manual filter classification only conducted by me
