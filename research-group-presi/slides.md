# Motivation

What are edit filters?
Why are there edit filters?
What task(s) do they take care of?
How are they different from other existing mechanisms?

---

> "The edit filter is a tool that allows editors in the *edit filter manager* group to set controls mainly to address common patterns of harmful editing."

# Structure

(of the presi? or of the thesis?)

---

# Vandalism on Wikipedia

---

Def:

> "On Wikipedia, vandalism has a very specific meaning: editing (or other behavior) deliberately intended to obstruct or defeat the project's purpose, which is to create a free encyclopedia, in a variety of languages, presenting the sum of all human knowledge."

<small>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism)</small>

# Fighting vandalism on Wikipedia

---

Literature review:

bots, semi-automated tools, ores, humans

---

## Important to study algorithmic mechamisms

* increased relative share of edits
* difference not only of scale but of substance
* intransparency and gatekeeping

---

## Bots

* 1st line of defence
* fastest revert time
* ClueBot NG, ...

---

## Semi-automated tools

* Huggle, Twinkle, STiki, ..

---

## ORES

* can be used by bots or semi-automated tools

---

## Humans

* watchlists
* manual reverts of chance discoveries

---

Summary:
funnel diagram (without filters)
One thing is ostentatiously missing: edit filters

---

(# Methods)

---

# Data

* wikipedia's pages (policies, guidelines, etc.), most prominently: ...
* abuse filter extention tables

---

# Descriptive Overview. What is an edit filter?

---

---

## MediaWiki Extension

* permissions
* tables: *abuse_filter*, *abuse_filter_log*, *abuse_filter_action* and *abuse_filter_history*
* actions filters trigger: logging, warning, throttling, disallowing, revoking auto-promoted groups, blocking, removing from privileged groups, range-blocking, tagging
* smth else?

## Introducing a new filter

For everybody:

* checklist: is an edit filter the suitable solution
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Filters are applied to all edits. Therefore, problematic changes that apply to a single page are likely not suitable for an edit filter."
    \item filters, after adding up, make editing slower
    \item in depth checks should be done by a separate software that users run on their own machines
    \item no trivial errors should be catched by filters (ala style guidelines)
    \item there are Titles Blacklist and Link/Spam Blacklist which should be used if the issue at hand has to do with a problematic title or link.
\end{itemize}
* request at: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/Requested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/Requested)

For edit filter managers:

* read the docs
* run tests
* Generally, always set action to logging only first
* Announce at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter_noticeboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter_noticeboard) and receive feedback
* possibly change the filter action

---

## Who can edit filters

* *abusefilter-modify* permission
* March 9, 2019: 152 users in the *edit filter managers* group (and 1181 admins)
* (4 users on CA Wikipedia, and the role doesn't exist on the DE, ES, RU or BG wiki)

---

## How are problems handled

Edit Filter Noticeboard:

* current filters behaviour: e.g. changing filter action or updating pattern
* users rights discussions

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/False_positives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_filter/False_positives):

* monitored by edit filter managers
* update filters
* help good faith users
* discourage malicious edits

Personal security best practices for edit filter managers

## Motivations for introducing the abuse filter extention

Quote from EditFilter discussion archive

---

Also from the archive:
abuse filter -> edit filter

---

## Collaboration bots-filters

"There is a bot reporting users tripping certain filters at WP:AIV and WP:UAA; you can specify the filters here."
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DatBot/filters}

* consider collaborations filters/bots (e.g. MrZ Bot which puts editors found on the abuse log often on the AIV noticeboard.) are there further exampled for this kind of collaborations?

## State of the Art on EN Wikipedia

Data analysis

---

# Next steps for finishing the thesis

* abuse_filter_history table (ping Aaron)


---

# Beyond the thesis

* What are the differences between how filters are governed on EN Wikipedia compared to other language versions?
* Are there filters targetting harassment?
* Ethnographic analysis (e.g. IVs with edit filter managers/admins/users whose edits have been disallowed would be really interesting)
* (how) has the notion of "vandalism" on Wikipedia evolved over time (when looking at the regex patterns)
* Precision/Recall: False Positives? were filters shut down, bc they matched more False positives than they had real value?
* Do filters work the desired way/help for a smoother Wikipedia service or is it a lot of work to maintain them and the usefulness is questionable?
* What can we filter with a REGEX? And what not? Are regexes the suitable technology for the means the community is trying to achieve?

---

# Current Limitations

* Only EN Wikipedia
* manual filter classification only conducted by me

---

# Bigger picture: Upload filters
