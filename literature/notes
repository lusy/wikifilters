personal attacks

methodology: crowd-sourcing + machine learning
looked at comments on Wikipedia talk pages
100k human labeled comments
63k machine labeled (classifier)
generated data set:

analysed time period: 2004-2015

"The primary contribution of this paper is a methodology for quan-
titative, large-scale, longitudinal analysis of a large corpus of on-
line comments."

Questions:
"What is the impact of allowing anonymous contributions, namely those from unregistered users?
How do attacks vary with the quantity of a user’s contributions?
Are attacks concentrated among a few users?
When do attacks result in a moderator action?
And is there a pattern to the timing of personal attacks?"

"the majority of personal attacks on Wikipedia are not
the result of a few malicious users, nor primarily the consequence
of allowing anonymous contributions from unregistered users"

"Report highlights that 73% of adult internet users have seen some-
one harassed online, and 40% have personally experienced it [5]."

"Platforms combat this with policies"
"Wikipedia has a policy of “Do not make personal attacks
anywhere in Wikipedia”[33] and notes that attacks may be removed
and the users who wrote them blocked. 1"

classifier: "character-level n-
grams result in an impressively flexible and performant classifier
for a variety of abusive language in English."

"The Wikimedia Foundation found that
54% of those who had experienced online harassment expressed
decreased participation in the project where they experienced the
harassment [23]"

"Through labeling
a random sample, we discovered that the overall prevalence of per-
sonal attacks on Wikipedia talk pages is around 1% (see Section
5.1)."

"Annotators whose accuracy on these test questions fell below a 70%
threshold would be removed from the task."
"This allows us to aggregate judgments
from 10 separate people when constructing a single label for each
comment. We chose 10 judgments based on experiments in Sec. 4.3"

note: the annotators could be biased and their judgement on what is a personal attack may differ from this of the Wikipedian community

"approximately 30% of attacks
come from registered users with over 100 contributions."
"that less than a fifth of personal attacks currently trigger any action
for violating Wikipedia’s policy."
"personal attacks clus-
ter in time - perhaps because one personal attacks triggers another.
If so, early intervention by a moderator could have a disproportion-
ately beneficial impact."

discussion:
"While there are many such questions to analyze,
some notable examples include:
1. What is the impact of personal attacks on a user’s future con-
tributions?
2. What interventions can reduce the level of personal attacks
on a conversation?
3. What are the triggers for personal attacks in Wikipedia com-
ments?"
