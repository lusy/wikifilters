# Edit filter managers who are also bot operators


User: Aaron Schulz https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Aaron_Schulz
VoABot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:VoABot
    Tasks:
    A) This bot automatically cleans up WP:RfPP (requests for page protection). It makes it so that each "current" section can have no more than 3 consecutive 6+ hour old fullfilled/denied requests. They are moved to the fullfilled/denied section, which can only have no more than 15 requests unless they are less than 12 hours old. The extra ones are removed. Additionally, entries with certain formatting mistakes are fixed.
    B) This bot keeps the list of admins JS list variable up to date at User:VoABot/adminlist.js. This avoids slower and more server using HTTP request checks when users get history stats from User:Voice of All/History/monobook.js. This is used by this bot for RfPP clearing and by VoABot II as the whitelist.
    C) This bot keeps the list of bots JS list variable up to date at User:VoABot/botlist.js. This avoids slower and more server using HTTP request checks when users get history stats from User:Voice of All/History/monobook.js.
    Vandalism related?: kind of; requests for page protection.. but it's more maintenance on the page than direct

VoABot II https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:VoABot_II
    Tasks:
    The purpose of this approved bot is to patrol articles and prevent banned users/trolls with revolving IPs/proxies from disrupting articles too much. This is useful against both long-term steady vandalism of certain pages or vandalbot attacks on many random pages. Semi-protection cannot be used for random page vandalism and it can be needlessly limiting if long-term use is applied to pages just to stop shared IP vandals. Additionally, "throwaway" accounts can make semi-protection end up as full protection.

General shared IP vandalism and spam patrol and page move patrol are also included. Similarly, move-protection is useless against random page move attacks.
    A) In the case where banned users continue to use sockpuppet accounts/shared IPs/open proxies to add edits clearly rejected by consensus to the point where long term protection is required, VoABot II may be programmed to watch those pages and revert those edits instead. Such edits are considered blacklisted. IP ranges can also be blacklisted from the bot's watchlist. This is reserved only for special cases.

    B) VoABot II patrols recent changes and checks all edits by logged-out AOL, other shared IP users, and IPs that are acting as hosts (open ports). Any detected vandalism is reverted. This is done to avoid IP revolving spammers that hit multiple pages at random.

    C) The move log is patrolled by VoABot II for page moves to inappropriate names by possible vandals. Such page moves will be reverted.
    Vandalism related?: yes

Which filters the editor has worked on? Can't find conclusive data

User:Addshore https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Addshore
Addbot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Addbot
    Tasks: no description found on page; but was smth along the lines of deleteing interwiki language links, since these moved to Wikidata?
    Vandalism related?: no

    Vandalism related?: a ton of maintenance tasks, none of the directly related to vandalism

-------------------------------------------------------

User: Beetstra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Beetstra
XLinkBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:XLinkBot
    Tasks:
    XLinkBot is primarily intended to deal with domains which may have a legit use on-wiki, but are frequently misused by new and anonymous users (or have a history of being misused). The bot allows established users to add links, while reverting links added by others. IP's and new users can still edit a page that contains links on the bot's revert list, they won't be reverted unless they add or change a link themselves.

    XLinkBot can also serve as a good "step-up" to, or "step-down" from, the Mediawiki:Spam-blacklist, allowing time to see if the URL continues to be abused.

    The Override list and the HardOverride list should only be used for short-term issues. If URLs are being abused to the point that the override is necessary on a long-term basis - they should be placed on the Mediawiki:Spam-blacklist.

    Sites which are completely inappropriate for Wikipedia belong on the Mediawiki:Spam-blacklist rather than the RevertList.

    At the request of the community, we have extended the ability to modify XLinkBot's revert list and revert behavior to all English Wikipedia admins. This can be done by editing the XLinkBot control pages noted below.
    Vandalism related: yes

CheMoBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CheMoBot
    Tasks:
    Extract infoboxes from mainspace pages, and saving them on subpages of a Wikiproject for verifying the data in there. From then reporting changes to mainpage infoboxes (when 'verified' data gets changed) to a report page under the same wikiproject for manual review.
    Keeping an eye on verifyable numerical data in infoboxes (e.g. 'boilingPtC = 100' for water (molecule) in the {{chembox}}, or 'birth_date = May 29, 1917' for John F. Kennedy in the {{Infobox President}}
    Vandalism related?: I'd say yes, it verifies, whether data in infoboxes makes sense

COIBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:COIBot
    Tasks:
    COIBot is a bot that tries to track edits that are made by users who may have a conflict of interest. (see bot page for longer version)
    Vandalism related?: kind of, there are definitely also edit filters I've labeled as COI...

Which filters has the editor worked on?
https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:AbuseFilter/history/0&dir=prev&user=Beetstra&filter=
* 48, Oft-inappropriate external links - created by Beetstra on 18.3.2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=48; looks like testing stuff similar to what XLinkBot is doing; filter is disabled the same day it's created since " Turned off, this rule seriously slows down the wiki.  Needs to be checked" and never re-enabled; marked as deleted on 25.3.2009
* 172, Section blanking --> Beetstra seem to have introduced the filter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=172
  it is set to tag "Section blanking"
* 126, Youtube links --> seems related to what XLinkBot is doing; Beetstra seems to also be the editor who introduced the filter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=126
  BRFA for original XLinkBot (then SquelchBot) was filed on 11 January 2008 by Versageek
  BRFA for XLinkBot 2 (most recent?) was filed on 17 January 2009 by Beetstra
  according to above cited filter history link, edit filter 126 was initially introduced by Beetstra on 1 April 2009; the comments on the filter suggest that it was introduced to support XLinkBot: "Continuous insertion of youtube movies, undoing XLinkBot reverts, etc. etc."; the filter was initially hidden and set to "disallow";
  Does this signal towards a pattern of a bot notices something, or more malicious editors keep reverting bot's edits which eventually results in implementing a filter which disallows the action from the beginning.
* 129, Possible tireless sock creating film pages of non-existing films --> introduced by Beetstra https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=129; was tagging hits with "Tag: Nonsense movies?" and deleted by User:NawlinWiki on 2.2.2012
* 323, Undoing anti-vandalism bot --> filter for edits that undo edits by XLinkBot and ClueBot NG (historically couple of others as well); was introduced by Tim1357 on 26.4.2010 as a hidden filter and was tagging hits with "Tag: reverting anti-vandal bot"; Beetstra added XLinkBot to the check on 16.11.2010 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history/323/diff/prev/6618
  So this is an example of using filters to support bot work
* 76, Adding email address -- filter was warning if an email address was added to a article namespace page; it was introduced on 21.3.2009 and marked as deleted on 30.8.2009; Beetstra's contributions to the filter: turning off the warning, since recognised the regex as not precise enough (e.g. catching also urls containing "@"); adding "XLinkBot" to the accounts that are allowed to be ignored by the filter
  So, this again is an example of constructing a filter in such a way that it collaborates with an existing bot
* 643,Persistent sockpuppetry - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 892, RS linked through proxy (not quite sure what RS means) - Beetstra introduced the filter on 5.12.2017 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=892 and updated the filter action to "Warn: Abusefilter-warning-proxy-link" 5 days later and to "disallow" on 9.1.2018
* 639,persistent block evasion - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 455,Bahrani - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 910, Maureen Wroblewitz spammer - is a typical example of a filter targetting a particular case (with particular page?) -- Beetstra introduced the filter on 4.4.2018 as hidden; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=910 ; was actually also the only edit filter manager to ever contribute to this filter; Beetstra marked the filter as deleted on 14.7.2018 when apparently the incidents were not occuring anymore; a filter that was created to respond to a particular incident, ran for a while (approx 3 months) and was disabled again.
* 911,Wrestling social networking spammer - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 933,Deepak Khumar - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 317,Sentry Gun - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 758,Block evading editor - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 603,Special case of reverting XLinkBot reverts - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details; however XLinkBot is mentioned in the description and this is again an example of building a filter to support a particular existing bot
* 108, Hangon Tag - Beetstra reordered conditions for optimisation reasons: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history/108/diff/prev/1084 (filter was later deleted by User:Prodego with the remark that this type of warning already happens elsewhere and this is not what filters are supposed to be used for)
* 612,Wrestling pusher - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 162,Thermal bag - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 791,Spam(bot|mer)s continuously hitting the spam blacklist - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 85,Beetstra - speed testing rules - although filter is hidden, the description points us towards a typical filter for testing purposes
* 893, Predatory open access journals - introduced by Beetstra on 6.12.2017 and deleted again the same day https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=893 (probably doubling since filter 891 is already  named "Predatory open access journals" and was introduced on 3.12.2017 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=891 ; Beetstra added some additional domains to check to this filter on 11.12.2017 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history/891/diff/prev/18262); since both filters were introduced so close in time to one another I can imagine that there was an incident/discussion/request for such a filter and two different people went on and implemented it without coordinating with eachother.
* 130,Kaveh L. Afrasiabi - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 907,St. Bernard (dog) -- enabled by Beetstra on 21.3.2018 because of a particular incident (as it seems), but never actually tripped. disabled again on 30.12.2018 by Galobtter https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=907
* 160,"Punchbowl, New South Wales" - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Beetstra was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 81, Badcharts -- only one edit, disabling the filter for couple of hours, since percieved as too slow and potentially able to cause a timeout (filter was deleted 6 year later in June 2015)
* 61, New user removing references - introduced by Beetstra on 19 March 2010 (who never touched it again). This is the filter with highest hitcount in the history of edit filters; was disabled between 3.3.2012 (with the argument there are too many false positives; which could explain the high hitcount as well^^) and 3.5.2015. Up and running today.
* 627, Promotional text added by user to draft in own user(-talk) page or in draft namespace -- introduced by Beetstra as a hidden filter on 18 August 2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=627 ; according to comments: "Split from Edit Filter 354"; made public by Rich Farmbrough on 6 August 2015, apparently according to a discussion

User: Chris G https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chris_G
AntiAbuseBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AntiAbuseBot
    Tasks:
    Watches the rc feed for actions that match known vandals and takes necessary action (e.g. send off an alert on irc, revert the edit, revert the edit and block the user or just block the user), currently I have it setup with regexes that match grawp and also some spambots. Also I have been running this bot under my main account for some time now.

    Interestingly, there is a discussion on the bot's request for approval page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/AntiAbuseBot), stating that it would become obsolete once abuse filters are implemented: "When the abuse filter is installed I'll happily shut the bot down, however it hasn't been installed yet (much to my disappointment) and it could be quite some time before it is installed so I feel there is a need for this bot, and I would rather get it properly approved than run it under my main account like I have been --Chris 04:18, 9 January 2009 (UTC)"

    Bot appears to be inactive; last changes it made were from 17.1.2011 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/AntiAbuseBot

Chris G Bot 3 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chris_G_Bot_3
    Tasks: This bot archives threads at WP:CHU/S (changing username simple) (WP:CHU/U (changing username/usurpations) is archived by AnomieBOT). It checks if threads need archiving every hour. The bot will only archive a thread if {{done}} or {{notdone}} is present and has been placed by a flagged 'crat (see here for a list of current 'crats). {{done}} threads are archived when the last timestamp in the thread is older than 12 hours. {{notdone}} threads are archived when the timestamp is older than 36 hours. If you have any bugs, questions, comments etc please leave me a message. The source code can be seen here.

The bot can also be configured to clerk WP:CHU. To do this simply replace the text on /clerk with true

Chris G Bot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chris_G_Bot
    Tasks: This bot tags images that do not have a valid copyright tag for deletion per WP:CSD#F4. Please note that copyright tags should not be substituted as this means that the bot cannot read it correctly.
    Vandalism related?: not really, but I think there are edit filters tackling similar tasks

Chris G Bot 2 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Chris_G_Bot_2
    (Clone of the PockBot)
    Tasks: The purpose of PockBot is to produce for a given wikipedia category, a table listing all articles within that category (and all subcategories of that category), as well as the status of those articles. This is of use for editors in monitoring new stub articles within their categories and bringing them swiftly up to full article status, as well as providing visitors to the category with a "todo" list of articles needing work.
Given a wikipedia category page to start from, it finds all articles listed in that category as well as all subcategories of that category. For every subcategory it pulls a list of articles. For all articles retrieved (a list of all articles in that category and its subcategories) it then retrieves the CLASS flag for each page from wikipedia. It then presents these results in tabulated form.
    Vandalism related: no

    The image is orphaned
    The image has a fair use licensing tag and no free licensing tag
    and the image has been tagged for deletion for at least 7 days

Which filters has the editor worked on?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=Chris+G&filter=
* 78, Cross-wiki malbot vandals - Chris G introduced the filter on 21.3.2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=78 ; filter was disabled on 26.04.2009 since apparently nothing was tripping it at the time and deleted on 17.5.2009 to never reappear again (last filter hit was on 30.03.2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseLog?wpSearchUser=&wpSearchPeriodStart=&wpSearchPeriodEnd=&wpSearchTitle=&wpSearchImpact=0&wpSearchAction=any&wpSearchActionTaken=&wpSearchFilter=78)
* 184,abusive edit summaries - as of 6.01.2019 (the date our data set originates from), Chris G was the last editor to modify this filter. It is however hidden, so we don't know any details
* 511,test filter - typical test filter by the Chris G Testaccount. Hidden but yeah.

    Vandalism related: duh.

Which filters has the editor worked on?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=Cobi&filter=
* 197, Duplicate section - introduced by Cobi on 26 June 2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=197; disabled by Prodego on 27 June 2009  with the comment "Please, don't use the abuse filter for this, it isn't abuse. Disabled to reduce number of edits hitting the condition limit -Prodego" (explanation for the filter was "This is to find duplicate sections added (clicking save on the new section page twice). -- Cobi"); 8 July 2009 marked as deleted by Ruslik0
* 246, "Imma let you finish ..." new meme -- introduced by Cobi as new filter on 16 September 2009 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=&filter=246 (hidden); it never hit anything, and was consequently made public by Prodego on 27.9.2009.

16 September 2009 was also the last time User:Cobi edited something on a public edit filter. So unless they're active in the creation of hidden filters (which we cannot easily verify), we can guess that they lost interest in filters altogether. ClueBot NG is introduced in October 2010.

User: cyberpower678 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Cyberpower678
InternetArchiveBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:InternetArchiveBot
    Tasks: InternetArchiveBot (abbreviated as IABot), is an advanced bot designed to combat link rot, as well as fix inconsistencies in sources such as improper template usage, or invalid archives.

You can use this bot yourself by browsing the history of any page, and clicking on the "Fix dead links" link in the "External tools" section at the top of the page.

Under the hood, Cyberbot has an immense, and ever growing, database, where each URL is saved along with details with, and archive snapshots, either queried from the Wayback Machine, or collected elsewhere on Wikipedia. On top of that, the bot is highly customizable to suit the wiki's needs. Several options can be customized, such as which sources to touch, which pages to scan, and whether or not to scan live links and act on that information. IABot is still in ongoing development, to support additional wikis, but is complete for the English Wikipedia.

Which filters has the editor worked on?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=Mr.+Stradivarius&filter=
no filters listed? I can't find out of the notice board archives when the user was granted edit filter manager rights, so cannot say whether they never edited a filter because they have not been there long (although that would not make particular sense either, since mostly editors are granted permissions out of a particular occasion..)

Interestingly, we could say the XLinkBot dev is a bot person, who has implemented a couple of minor filter (changes) to facilitate the work of XLinkBot.
In contrast, MusikAnimal seems to be a filter person, who has implemented a couple of bots that track (and help facilitate) filter work. (And a couple of others, entirely unrelated bots).
MusikAnimal is a quite active edit filter manager who seems to do a lot of maintenance work on a great number of filters. (investigate in more detail filter work)

User: Scottywong https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Scottywong
Snotbot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Snotbot
    Tasks:
    Task 1
    Snotbot monitors the backlog at Special:Newpages and identifies articles that have not been patrolled for 30 days after creation. Such articles are normally deleted from the Newpages queue and are never patrolled. When an unpatrolled, 30+ day old article is found, Snotbot adds the {{New unreviewed article}} template to the top of the article, allowing it to be tracked at Category:Unreviewed new articles. The bot also posts a list of these articles on the monthly index page at Wikipedia:New pages patrol/Unpatrolled articles.
    Note: This task has been suspended indefinitely.
    Task 2
    See also: Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Snotbot 2
    Snotbot tagged all image files on video game articles with {{WikiProject Video games}} so that the Wikiproject can track and maintain these images more efficiently (about 20,000 images total). This script may be used in the future to tag image files for other WikiProjects.
    Task 3
    See also: Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Snotbot 3
    Snotbot replaced all section headings of "==Plot synopsis==" with "==Plot==". This script may be used in the future to find and replace text in selected articles.
    Task 5
    See also: Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Snotbot 5
    Snotbot finds articles with improper heading hierarchies and fixes them. Headers should always increment sequentially and not skip levels. For instance, a ==Level 2== header should never be immediately followed by a ====Level 4==== header. Proper hierarchy is important for accessibility.
    Task 9
    See also: Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Snotbot 9
    Snotbot analyzes the list of articles that are currently tagged for rescue by the Article Rescue Squadron and compiles a table with information about them. The table is located at Wikipedia:Article Rescue Squadron/Article list. This task is no longer active.
    Task 10
    See also: Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Snotbot 10
    Snotbot checks recent AfD's to ensure that they have been transcluded to the daily log, and that the articles under discussion still have an AfD template on them. It also creates two reports:
        User:Snotbot/AfD report - lists potentially problematic pages that the bot couldn't deal with
        User:Snotbot/Current AfD's - sortable table of all currently open AfD's and some statistics about them
    Task 12
    See also: Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Snotbot 12
    Snotbot clerks WP:RFPP (requests for page protection) and automatically archives old threads. This task has editable parameters which can be viewed/edited on User:Snotbot/RFPP. This task can also be temporarily stopped by editing User:Snotbot/RFPP.

    Vandalism related?: kind of: helps patrolling/reviewing newly created articles

Which filters has the editor worked on?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=Scottywong&filter=
Public filters:
* 479, Adding example.jpg to article space -- was introduced by Scottywong on 26 June 2012; filter was disabled 1.5 years later (January 2014) with the argument that it's more likely to scare newbies off rather than encourage them to fix the problem and that they are gonna fix it anyway upon seeing the example.jpg in the published article; in June 2016 the filter was marked as deleted, since the check for example.jpg was now incorporated in filter 631

Hidden filters: (user was the last to modify it)
* 482,Using comments to evade edit filter

User:Shirik https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Shirik
TorNodeBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:TorNodeBot
    Tasks:
    TorNodeBot is a bot that monitors the Tor network and ensures that Wikipedia exit nodes (those nodes in the Tor network that can be the last "hop" and route data to its final destination) can not edit, in accordance with our policy on Open proxies. The TorBlock extension is supposed to handle this automatically, but tends to miss several exit nodes and goes down on occasion. TorNodeBot fills in the gaps left open by the extension. This bot runs continuously and applies blocks when all of the following 3 conditions are met:

        The node is present in the Tor directory service as an exit node router
        The node is responding to requests and can route to Wikipedia's sandbox
        The node is not blocked already by the TorBlock extension

When all three of these conditions are met, a temporary block is placed on the node.
    Vandalism related?: maybe indirectly, since users with malicious motivations may try to hide their IPs

Which filters has the editor worked on?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history?user=Shirik&filter=
Public filters:

* 1, !!!!! in the article-space (then name, 29.4.2010, today that's the "General test filter")
* 3, New user blanking articles - one of th first filters ever; used to give a warning, was set to "disallow" by Galobtter on 18 January 2019; Shirik edited once letting it monitor namespace Portal as well (present-day version only monitors the main article namespace)
* 9, Personal attacks by unregistered or new user (filter is disabled at the moment, since 11 September 2012; used to be hidden  12 September 2010-9 September 2012); introduced on 18.3.2009 by Bjweeks; permamently set to "disallow" on 20.3.2009; Shirik added/removed (swear words) from the reference regex 2 times in Feb 2010
* 11, You/He/She/It sucks - introduced by X! on day2 after the activation of the extension: 18 March 2009; filter still active; it issues warnings, was briefly set to "disallow" between 27 April 2010-30 April 2010; and was hidden between 12 September 2010-21 August 2012; Shirik was the editor who removed the "disallow" action and set it to "tag", since there were false positives (according to comment)
* 12, Replacing a page with obscenities - introduced by Nihiltres on day 2: 18.3.2019; set to "warn" and "disallow"; set to "hidden" by Prodego later the same day. Set again to public by MusikAnimal on 6 June 2017 following a discussion and consensus on the privacy (or publicity^^) of general vandalism filters: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=784131724#Privacy_of_general_vandalism_filters; Shirik edited multiple times in order to update the regex to accomodate false positives on 28 January 2010; (in the meantime they also briefly took out all filter actions but logging); they also edited to update the "bad words filter list" to accomodate names of a couple of edit filter managers who were apparently targetted by trolls at the time;
* 46, "Poop" vandalism - introduced by Nihiltres on 18 March 2009 (day2); set to "warn" the same day and to "disallow" on 19 March 2009; was briefly set to "hidden" by Tim1357 on 28 April 2010 and reverted to public on 29.4.2010 by Prodego with the comment "Should not be private. -P"; Shirik updated the regex upon several occasions in order to accomodate to recent incidents probably and disabled the filter altogether for a couple of hours on 29.4.2010 because it was consuming up too many conditions: "Disabling. We're near 5% condition limit hits and this is a candidate for the culprit. -- Shirik"; Shirik then enabled the filter again, later the same day, after updating/optimising the filter pattern
* 61, New user removing references - introduced on day 3: 19.3.2009 by MacGyverMagic; they set it to "hidden" on  20 March 2009 which was consequently removed by Zzuuzz on 22.3.2009 bc deemed unnecessary; filter was disabled on 3 March 2012 and marked as "deleted" on 4 April 2013; it was enabled again on 3 May 2015 by Rich Farmbrough in "log only" mode; on 22 October 2016 Cenarium set filter action to "Tag: references removed"; Shirik updated the edit delta on  25 January 2010 in order to accomodate particulare cases of sockpuppetry
* 79, New user removing reference grouping tags - Shirik's contribution on 14.5.2010 is "Reset filter, it hit the 5% limit somehow. -- Shirik 14 May 2010" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:AbuseFilter/history/79/diff/prev/5529 (not quite sure what the 5% limit is or how does one reset a filter and what it means)
* 81, Badcharts - Shirik optimised the regex (and re-enabled the filter) on 24.4.2010, which was disabled on 21.4.2010 on grounds of being too expensive
* 82, Nowiki on urls - Shirik marked the filter as deleted on 2 May 2010, since it was apparently supereseded by filter 278
* 98, Creating very short new article -- switched on on 24.3.2009, an hour later "warn" is added as a filter action; disabled on 22 October 2009 with the comment "There is nothing wrong with a short article, lets not patronize. People can work in steps. Disable - P" (which I agree with) and re-enabled on 2 November 2009 albeit with "tag" as action, since User:Cenarium deemed it useful to be able to track the short newly created articles; Shirik edited the filter twice to optimise conditions/repair a typo
* 129, Possible tireless sock creating film pages of non-existing films - created by Beetstra on 3 April 2009, who also added a "tag" action on 5.4.2009; Shirik optimised conditions
* 135, Repeating characters - Shirik optimised the conditions and added new ones tested in a different filter (292)
* 148, Users creating autobiographies - Shirik optimised conditions
* 167, Botched submissions to Articles for creation - Shirik optimised pattern
* 225, Vandalism in all caps - there was a back and forth with disabling/changing the action from "disallow" to "warn" because of false positives; after a month the "disallow" action was restored since an editor reviewed the log and found no false positives in the last 100 hits; Shirik updated swear words blacklist and the made the regex more strict (users have to be "confirmed" instead of "autoconfirmed" in order to be allowed to do this)
* 260, Common vandal phrases -- Shirik: "Reverted changes by Tim1357 due to high rate of false positives. Looking into what happened. -- Shirik 26 Apr 2010"; was hidden for quite a while before made public by MusikAnimal with "Public per [[Special:Permalink/784131724#Privacy of general vandalism filters]] and the guideline ~MA" on 6 June 2017; updated swear words black list
* 280, New user altering images - created and only ever touched by Shirik; was there for about 3 weeks, before Shirik deleted it on 31.1.2010; decided to disable/delete it, because of high condition count, false positives and deleted per request.
* 285, Common Vandalism - introduced 19.1.2010 by Shirik, initially hidden, subsequently made public (3.6.2010), probably on the grounds of genera vandalism filters, see above; Shirik was quite active on the filter, updated conditions, etc. Disabled by MusikAnimal that everything is convered in other filters "Disabling. Merged one rule into 384, now everything this filter captures should be handled by 380, 384, 614 and others ~MA 2016.09.11"
* 289, New user creating interrogative pages - introduced by Shirik on 7.2.2010 (reason: sounds like a how-to guide); Shirik tinkered on it for awhile; disabled on 14.4.2011, due to condition limit; marked as deleted on 4.4.2013
* 290, 172 Filter -- introduced by Shirik on 8 February 2010, and disabled, again by Shirik on 14.2.2010 on the ground of the relevant pages being protected
* 292, Repeating characters in edit summary -- "Merged to #135 to save desparately-needed conditions. - Shirik 12 Feb 2010" (mentioned already on 135) -- was enabled for an hour only before merged to 135
* 302, Possible COI - implemented by shirik bc of a particular incident probaly; deactivated and deleted by Shirik again, on grounds of insufficient activity
* 303, COI Page Creation -- similar to above filter; same IP targeted
* 304, Rayman vandalism -- introduced by Shirik on grounds of a particular incident ("Per WP:EF/R, prolific sock introducing deliberate inaccuracies. Log only for testing. -- Shirik 11 Mar 2010") on 12.3.2010; and disabled again + deleted on 20.3.2010 due to no hits
* 308, Malformed Mediation Cabal Requests - introduced by Shirik on 18.3.2010. disabled by Prodego on 21.3.2010 with "The abusefilter is intended to stop abusive edits. This is neither problematic, nor abusive. Disable - P"; deleted by Shirik on 23.3.2010
* 314, User creates article ending with a / - Shirik optimised conditions here; filter was eventually switched off, in order to save conditions, since the problem was deemed not that big; (there were 532 hits altogether)
* 329, SPI disruption -- introduced by Shirik on 10.5.2010 with the announcement "will be disabled soon"; never tripped; deleted by Shirik on 11.5.2010
* 338, Vuvuzela vandalism -- introduced by Shirik on 15.6.2010; active for 3 days, 5 hits; disabled again by Shirik on 18.6.2010, due to low activity; (Shirik also made it hidden -> public a couple of hours after introducing it)
* 343, Keemstar vandalism -- created by Shirik on 15.7.2010 due to a particular incident; 10 hits; deleted by NuclearWarfare on 20.9.2010

Hidden filters the editor was last to modify:
* 215,AnonTalk 2
* 283,Copyright violations in edit summaries
* 284,Image vandalism
* 286,Tokusatsu Vandal
* 297,Jeske's Test Filter
* 299,Personal attacks
* 300,Cross-posting
* 309,Unusual change of URLs
* 318,School attacks
* 321,Shirik's test filter
* 332,J.delanoy vandal
* 348,Rapid insertion of external links
* 349,Dudley Attacks
* 469,Shirik's Test Filter

Relatively active edit filter manager (or was quite active; all changes made by them come from 2010). Was the last editor to modify a number of hidden filters and has worked on quite some public filters, updating patterns, to accomodate new behaviour or in the attempt to reduce false positives; also in order to accommodate to the condition limit for filters (for which I'm still not quite certain how it works)

User: Slakr https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Slakr
SineBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SineBot
    Tasks:
    SineBot is a recent changes patrolling bot that uses api.php to spot edits made on certain pages the moment they happen.
    It will automatically add {{Unsigned}}, {{UnsignedIP}}, and {{Undated}} templates to comments left by registered and IP users, respectively.
    Except on pages that are frequently modified, the bot will normally give editors a grace period (a minute or so) to sign and date unsigned/undated comments before assuming that a particular editor forgot to sign.
    It runs continuously (except, obviously, for maintenance).
    If a particular user makes three or more unsigned comments in a 24 hour period, the bot will place a single {{uw-tilde}} advice message on his/her talk page.
    Reports obvious vandalism and suspected personal attacks to various anti-vandalism IRC channels.
    Vandalism related: yes, see last task

ProcseeBot https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ProcseeBot
    Tasks:
    ProcseeBot automatically blocks proxies due to both the local policy against open proxies on Wikipedia and Wikimedia's global policy against open proxies. It seeds information from public proxy lists and checks to make sure the proxy is open and usable, and if so, proceeds to block it.
    Vandalism related?: kinda, similar to TorNodeBot

    Tasks
    1 	AfC copyvio bot 	Reported possible copyright violations in Articles for creation submissions (formerly to User:EarwigBot/AfC copyvios, later with {{AfC suspected copyvio}}). Replaced by a web tool.
    2 	AfC statistics bot 	Updates Wikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/Statistics hourly, featuring pending and recently declined or accepted submissions.
    3 	AfC category maintenance bot 	Creates daily, monthly, and yearly categories at Category:AfC submissions by date. Runs daily at midnight UTC, creating categories three days in advance.
    4 	{{WikiProject Russian History}} removal 	Removed duplicate instances of {{WikiProject Russian History}}, per this BOTREQ.
    5 	Category:Undated AfC submissions cleanup 	Timestamps pages in Category:Undated AfC submissions to clear the category. Runs weekly on Sundays. (Task 7 has been merged into this task.)

    8 	AfC category delinking 	Delinks mainspace categories (and templates transcluding categories) from pages in Category:Declined AfC submissions. Runs weekly on Mondays.
    9 	Wrong MIME type tagging 	Tagged files whose extensions did not agree with their MIME types with {{rename media}}. Made unnecessary as MediaWiki now requires file extensions to match their MIME types.
    10 	{{DYK talk}} deprecation 	Merged {{DYK talk}} into {{ArticleHistory}}.
    11 	{{catmore}} replacement 	Would have replaced transclusions of {{main}} in the category namespace with {{catmore}}.

    13 	Image display resizing 	Corrected upscaled portraits in {{Infobox person}}. Made unnecessary by improved image handling in infoboxes and MediaWiki.
    14 	WikiProject tagging 	Tags talk pages of articles with WikiProject banners by request. All tagging runs are started manually, and require consensus from the WikiProject. Both lists of pages and list of categories (subcategories included or not included) can be tagged.

    19 	DRN clerk bot 	Carried out clerking tasks for the dispute resolution noticeboard (managing the {{DR case status}} template, leaving notices (with {{DRN-notice}} and {{DRN stale notice}}) as cases develop, and updating {{DRN case status}}).
    20 	{{Infobox station}} merging 	Replaced {{Infobox China station}} and {{Infobox Japan station}} with {{Infobox station}} following two template discussions (China, Japan) and a previous BRFA.
    Vandalism related: task 1 reports possible copyright vios, I've labeled some filters as copyright vio related

Public:
* 1, General test filter - has tested something probably^^
* 164, Possible cut and paste moves -- enabled 2.5.2009 by Dragons Flight; on since then; tagging enabled on 29.5.2009; The Earwig changed a string in the regex pattern to small case.
* 440, intextual.com markup - filter was enabled twice (8.11.2011-15.12.2011 and 16.7.2012-19.7.2012); The Earwig was the editor who enabled the filter the 2nd time; Gogo Dodo merged it to 345 then
* 642, OTRS template added by non-OTRS member (global) - introduced 23.11.2014 ("warn"); on 22.1.2017 "disallow" was added to filter actions; briefly disabled on 13.4.2018 (for 2mins); The Earwig added local bots to excluded user groups (updated filter pattern to reflect more closely the problem the filter was supposed to target)
* 733, New user creating a page in someone else's userspace - introduced by The Earwig on 2.11.2015: "Previously tested on Filter 1. Sometimes catches socking and other weirdness. - Earwig 2015-11-02"; pattern improved since then by Galobtter; still on and running, log only

    Tasks:
    Mass tagging of templates being nominated for TFD and MFD
        This bot account is used to run the masstag script, which applies a given tag en masse to a given set of pages. The approval extends solely to the following cases:
            Tagging with the {{tfd}} tag for mass TFD nominations;
            Tagging with the {{mfd}} tag for userboxes in the Template namespace which are involved in mass MFD nominations;
            Removing the {{tfd}} or {{mfd}} tags on templates which are being kept after a TFD or MFD discussion;
            Adding {{tfd end}} on the talk pages of templates which are being kept after a TFD discussion.
        Hence, the bot will only edit in the Template and Template talk namespaces.
        A function overview with more detail is available at the BRFA for this bot.
        Considering a mass TFD, but turned off by the prospect of tagging? Help is at hand!
        If you are planning to make a mass deletion nomination, you can harness the functionality of this bot by asking at This, that and the other's talk page.
