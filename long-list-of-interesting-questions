* What are the differences between how filters are governed on EN Wikipedia compared to other language versions?
* Are there filters targetting harassment?
* Ethnographic analysis (e.g. IVs with edit filter managers would be really interesting)
* What is to be learned from studying the regex patterns in more detail?
* what's filters' genesis story? why were they implemented? (compare with Rambot story) : try to reconstruct by examining traces and old page versions
* (how) has the notion of "vandalism" on Wikipedia evolved over time (when looking at the regex patterns)
