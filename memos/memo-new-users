# Memo new users

When comparing the *vandalism* and *good faith* memos, it comes to attention that both type of edits are usually performed by new(ly/recently registered) users (or IP addresses).

A user who just registered an account is most probably inexperienced with Wikipedia, not familiar with all policies and guidelines and perhaps nor with MediaWiki syntax.

It is also quite likely (to be verified against literature!) that majority of vandalism edits come from the same type of newly/recently registered accounts.
In general, it is highly unlikely that an established Wikipedia editor should at once jeopardise the encyclopedia's purpose and start vandalising.
