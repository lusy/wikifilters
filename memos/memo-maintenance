# Filters with maintenance purpose

Some of the encountered edit filters on the EN Wikipedia were targeting neither vandalism nor good faith edits.
These had rather their focus on (semi-)automating routine (clean up) tasks.

Some of the filters I labeled as "maintenance" were for instance recording cases of broken syntax caused by a faulty browser extention. (filter id!)
Others were targeting bugs such as.. 

577 -> "VisualEditor bugs: Strange icons"
345 -> "Extraneous formatting from browser extension"
313 -> "Skype Toolbar Formatting"
199 -> "Unflagged Bots"
505 -> "Tag mobile edits"
728 -> "Huggle"
209 -> "arwiki interwiki problem"

The maintenance parent category differs conceptually from the other 2 in so far that filters in it don't target particular **intents** of the editors whose edits are triggering the filter, but rather "side"-occurances that mostly went wrong.

## Bugs

There are some 10 or so filters I manually labeled as targeting "bugs".
Most of them do log only.
