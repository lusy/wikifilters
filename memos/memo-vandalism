# Filters targetting vandalism

The vast majority of edit filters on EN Wikipedia could be said to target (different forms of) vandalism.
Examples herefor are filters for *juvenile* types of vandalism (inserting swear or obscene words or nonsence sequences of characters into articles), for *hoaxing* or for *link spam*.
In principle, one can open quite a few subcategories here (also check https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism for a "in-house" classification of vandalism types on Wikipedia).
Some vandalism types seem to be more severe than others (*sock puppetry* or persistant *long term* vandals).
For these, often times, the implemented filters are **private**.
This means, only edit filter editors can view the exact filter pattern or the comments of these.
Although this clashes with the overall *transparency* of the project (is there a guideline subscribing to this value?), the reasoning here is that otherwise, persistent vandals will be able to check for the pattern of the filter targetting their edits and just find a new way around it.
There are also private filters targetting personal attack or abuse cases.
Here, filters are private in order to protect affected person(s).

The current state is also an "improvement" compared to the initially proposed visibility level of edit filters.
In the initial version of the EditFilters Page (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Edit_filter&oldid=221158142) Andrew Garrett (User:Werdna), the author of the AbuseFilter MediaWiki extention, was suggesting that all filters should be private and only a group of previously approved users should be able to view them.

According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism following (mostly disruptive) behaviours are **not vandalism**:
- boldly editing
- copyright violation
- disruptive editing or stubbornness --> edit warring
- edit summary omission
- editing tests by experimenting users: "Such edits, while prohibited, are treated differently from vandalism"
- harassment or personal attacks: "Personal attacks and harassment are not allowed. While some harassment is also vandalism, such as user page vandalism, or inserting a personal attack into an article, harassment in itself is not vandalism and should be handled differently."
- Incorrect wiki markup and style
- lack of understanding of the purpose of wikipedia: "editing it as if it were a different medium—such as a forum or blog—in a way that it appears as unproductive editing or borderline vandalism to experienced users."
- misinformation, accidental
- NPOV contraventions (Neutral point of view)
- nonsense, accidental: "sometimes honest editors may not have expressed themselves correctly (e.g. there may be an error in the syntax, particularly for Wikipedians who use English as a second language)."
- Policy and guideline pages, good-faith changes to: "If people misjudge consensus, it would not be considered vandalism;"
- Reversion or removal of unencyclopedic material, or of edits covered under the biographies of living persons policy: "Even factually correct material may not belong on Wikipedia, and removing such content when it is not in line with Wikipedia's standards is not vandalism."
- Deletion nominations: "Good-faith nominations of articles (or templates, non-article pages, etc) are not vandalism."

Several of these behaviours could actually be conceived as **good faith** edits.
And, for several of them (as noted in the **good faith memo**), it is not immediately distinguishable whether it's a **good faith** or a **vandalism** edit.
Ultimately, the "only" difference between the two arises from the motivation/context of the edit.


## Properties/Characteristics

- maliciously intended disruptive editing

motivations:
- seeking attention
- misusing the encyclopedia for own purposes (self-promotion, seo..)
- spreading wrong information
- defacing topics
