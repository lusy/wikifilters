# Meeting 20.06.2019

## Questions

* Ethics of compiling detailed lists of traces for single editors?
* discuss manual tags

## Manual tags

* get rid of the question mark:
  ** gather all filters with a question mark
  ** get rid of their label completely
  ** recode them
  (this guarantees also that bias of seeing the previous label is avoided)
* note in the methodology on inter- and intra-coder integrity
  ** to properly code the data, we need >=2 coders, there was unfortunately nobody else
  ** but I try to guarantee intracoder integrity via above point (compare also Mariam's methodology book)
* specific vs general tags
  ** gather all tags in a list and compile a Code Book out of them (-> put in Appendix)
  ** for every tag: definition, example, what makes it different from other tags? (if no difference can be determined -> merge)
  ** cross validation: go over data and recode with all available tags at the end
  ** when a distinct tag list is compiled -> cluster the tags into topics


## Ethical concerns

* we are in a open data / open science context; working on an open project (Wikipedia)
* concerns when thickening traces and compiling data on particular editors (compare also Trace Ethnography paper;)
  ** don't publish editors names - they are published themselves in different logs and locations, but don't publich extra compiled lists of stuff that will facilitate their explotation
