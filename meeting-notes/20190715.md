# Meeting 15.07.2019

* Evaluation? - it's ok
* Abstract in DE and EN?
* Discuss clusters (manual tagging)
  * 8 is too much; no clear distinction. boil them down to 3 (vandalism, good faith, maintenance) again; however where do the "seo/pov problems" go then?
  * does it make sense to have the subcategories (above all for vandalism)?
* Bots on Wikipedia: Unfolding their duties -> technical report?
* methods chapter vs explaining methodology in chapters? - methods chapter makes sense.
* split chapter 5: manual classification in a separate chapter? - nope
