# Meeting 04.07.2019

Revise Questions from Confluence:
  Q1 We wanted to improve our understanding of the role of filters in existing algorithmic quality-control mechanisms (bots, ORES, humans). -- chapter 4 (and 2)
     Subquestion (for discussion): Since filters are classical rule-based systems, what are suitable areas of application for such rule-based system in contrast to the other ML-based approaches. -- chapter 6 (discussion)

  Q2 Which type of tasks do these filters take over? -- chapter 5
     Subquestion: How these tasks evolve over time (are they changes in the type, number, etc.)? -- chapter 5 (can be significantly expanded)

Important to differentiate between parts that
* report results
* interpret results
