## New Questions

* to answer stats questions: study wikimedia api: toolserver?
  this seems to do the trick: https://quarry.wmflabs.org/query/32537
* current graphs: where does the data come from, how were the graphs programmed?
  still don't get it, poorly organised code in Portuguese, but see above for where the data can possibly come from
* how get the edit triggers counted?
  they get logged in the abuse_filter_log table
* what gets filtered?
  vandalism
  unintentional suboptimal behavior from new users who don't know better (blanking an article/section; creating an article without categories; adding larger texts without references)
* has the willingness of the community to use filters increased over time?
* why get certain filters 
* how do we classify them?
  * syntactic vs semantic vs ? (ALL CAPS is syntactic)
  * are there ontologies?
  * how is spam classified for example?
