## Questions

About the code book:
* good faith + area labeling
* how do I deal with labels introduced later? (process vs static code book)
* What exactly do I do with the cross-validation: compare both labelings, see how many of the cases I've labeled the same both times and then select a final version?
  ** an honest description of the process: intra-coder validity doesn't make much sense here with emergent coding and all
  ** plan time
     ** describe how can be proceeded ideally (create a 3rd labeled dataset where labels from both labelling sessions are compared and most suitable one is selected) and what I'll do now in the remaining time available

* filter patterns: qualitative observations?
  ** see time argument


## TODO
For next week:
* bring which chapters answer how the 3 questions defined in the intro
