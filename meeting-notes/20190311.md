# Meeting 11.03.2019

## Discussion/Announcements

* working to bring back abuse_filter_history table
* a realisation: number of filters cannot grow endlessly, every edit is checked against all of them and this consumes computing power! (signaled in various places) (and apparently haven't been chucked with Moore's law). is this the reason why number of filters has been more or less constanst over the years?
* go over and discuss data together


## TODO

* Frame in context: how do Wikipedia quality control mechanisms work? What is the contribution of edit filters?
* Why do filters exist? Why don't they just use Huggle?
* Hypothesis: filter should be used for frequently occurring cases (there's also the note that every edit is checked against all enabled filters, so it's not worth it to create filters for phenomena that occur rarely)? What issues are apparently frequently occurring?
