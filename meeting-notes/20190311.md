# Meeting 11.03.2019

## Questions

* Collect further data? IVs? /Stuart?

## Discussion/Announcements

* working to bring back abuse_filter_history table
* a realisation: number of filters cannot grow endlessly, every edit is checked against all of them and this consumes computing power! (signaled in various places) (and apparently haven't been chucked with Moore's law). is this the reason why number of filters has been more or less constanst over the years?
* go over and discuss data together
