# Meeting 26.04.2019

## Questions

* It's not ok to reuse graphics from other publications (with proper citation), is it (copyright)?

## Notes

* look at Timeline: the time span in which vandal fighting bots/semi-automated tools and then edit filters were introduced, fits logically into the process after the exponential growth of Wikipedia took off and it was no more the small group that could handle things but suddenly had to face a huge workload which wasn't feasible without technical support.
* in consecuence, edits of a lot of newcomers from that time were reverted stricter than before (with the help of the automated tools) which drove a lot of them away

## TODO

context is in the meantime quite sufficient to explain the motivation for studying edit filters and also how and why they came to be

    
## Fun facts
