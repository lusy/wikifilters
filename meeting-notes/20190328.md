# Meeting 28.03.2019

## Questions

* Go through thesis structure
  ** how about an evaluation chapter?

## TODO

* also comment on negative results!
* for the edit filter chapter: which pages have I studied and which I haven't (why I limited the choice there? it's not possible to study everything, but study the things I study, well!)
* consider collaborations filters/bots (e.g. MrZ Bot which puts editors found on the abuse log often on the AIV noticeboard.) are there further exampled for this kind of collaborations?
* find out: who and how can become an edit filter manager?
* who moderates the false positives page

* for upcoming meetings: bring single chapters/subchapters and discuss their findings
