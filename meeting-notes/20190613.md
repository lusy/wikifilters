## Questions

* Are there bots that look through entire article texts? A pontential clever vandal may split offensive content between several edits to make detection more difficult.
  ** no; bots make edit based checks; semi-automated tools queue edits as well, but humans are better at assessing such type of more eloquent vandalism, since they also read the edits (context of the edits as well); for particular articles there are also "owners", i.e. people responsible who check the content regularly
  ** still, there is of course no 100% quality guarantee.
* Who's talking? "I" vs "we" - I
* classification: when based on actions/hidden-vs-public only, we take the community's assessment for what vandalism is at face value. Are we satisfied with this? Or do we want to critically question we have the same perception about vandalism? In theory edit filter managers could be blatantly misusing their privileges and filtering who knows what.
  ** tja. too late now to worry over this^^.


## Notes

* focus on the 3 questions and the data we already have! *Don't* start anything new!
* framing question: why does filter legacy system still exist in times of fancier machine learning tools?


## TODO

* What are typical filter usage patterns?
  ** switched on for a while, then deactivated and never activated again?
  ** switched on and still on
  ** switched on for a while, deactivated for a while, activated again?
  ** ...
  ** irregular?

* What do filters target: general behaviour vs edits by single users
  ** there are quite some filters targeting particular users
  ** there are also some targetting particular pages (verify!), although this clashed with the guidelines
  ** and there are some filtering in general

* How do filters emerge?
  ** an older filter is split?
  ** several older filters are merged?
  ** new condition(s) are tested and then merged into existing filter

* How stable is the filter maker community?
  ** how many new users have become part of it over time?
  ** Has it been the same people from the very beginning?
  ** are there a couple of very active edit filter managers, that are also (informal) leaders?
  ** Do edit filter managers specialize on particular types of filters (e.g. vandalism vs good faith?)
