## Questions

* Collect further data? IVs?
* What is the research question?
  * Precision/Recall: False Positives? were filters shut down, bc they matched more False positives than they had real value?
  * How has the notion of vandalism changed over time (not particularly computer sciency..)?
  * What are disallow/block filters doing? Is it too great an intervention that drives new editors away? (Can we answer that?)
