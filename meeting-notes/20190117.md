# Meeting 17.01.2019

## Questions

* I think, I need at least one more person annotating filters
* When should I register the thesis?


## TODO

* Overleaf account create
* Test a filter!
  * what are the consequences for the editor who triggered it?

* What exactly is vandalism for filter maintainers?
  * read policies
  * go over all filters tagged as "vandalism" again and have a closer look: concrete words and phrases?
  * how has the concept of "vandalism" evolved over time? Compare older and newer "vandalism" filters
