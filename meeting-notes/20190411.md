# Meeting 11.04.2019

## Questions

* Is it essential that we have somewhat current data on bot/automated tools aided edits? As far as I can see, last data on the subject are from Geiger2011 which is 10 years old in the mean time..
* 30min meetings on separate days

## Notes
2-Background

* Background on vandalism based directly on Wikipedia is original research! We want to have the literature review in this chapter
  ** keep it small (or leave it for later altogether)
  ** only clarifications in exceptional cases (when I've got the feeling, definitions/notions, etc. are really not clear without this)
  ** C. finds the typology interesting, maybe we can use it for determining how/for what different quality control machanisms are used

* Purpose of this chapter is to concisely show the state of knowledge of the scientific community about quality control machanisms on Wikipedia

## TODO

* Look for more recent papers/numbers concerning (algorithmic) quality control: newer papers by Geiger/Halfaker? (check google scholar)
* Take a step back, make a more high level overview: how does all this come together?
  ** use an analog concept orga/sorting approach (headings on post-its or similar)
  ** begin at the end: what do I want to achieve? (find the edit filters' place in whole construction)
* At the end of this chapter I want to know where the filters fit in: what gap they fill? (Or maintain it's still not clear)
* Visualise the quality control system
  what happens (can happen) when a new edit is submitted
  ** a filter is triggered
  ** edit is rejected
  ** complain at false positives
  ** or edit is altered and submitted
  ** edit can get completely reverted by
     ** Cluebot NG
     ** other vandal fighting bots (Cluebot NG is mostly the fastest)
     ** Huggle (or other tool)
  ** editor is warned
  ** editor can bring their edit back
  ** second warning
  ** ...
* is there already an overview of the quality control mechanisms on Wikipedia by any chance
    
* send C. a high level overview next week
