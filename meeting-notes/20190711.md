# Meeting 11.07.2019

* Would you explain what a "diff" is? - nope
* Should I put tables and data I'm not sure what it's good for (no coherent comment on my part so far) in the appendix? or just leave them in jupyter notebook? The latter makes probably more sense, it's only the supervisors who read the whole thing anyway and should ever anyone be interested in expanding the analysis they'll be probably looking at the notebook
  (in particular the question was concerning my computations on "last modified")

* decide whether to keep data of the sort; it's not very accurate (since hidden filters are missing), there is no interesting tendency and I don't have any particular commentary on it:
  Table ... show how many new filters have been introduced over the years.
  2009: ~280 ; 1~27x (hidden, so we don't know)
  2010: ~100 ; 280 (6.1.2010)- smth between 379 (28.12.2010) and 384 (10.2.2011)
  2011: ~70  ; ~380 - 44x (440 is Nov 2011, 458 is April 2012)
  2012: ~70  ; ~450 - 51x (514 is Dec 2012, 520 is Jan 2013)
  2013: ~80  ; ~520 - 59x (593 is 3.10.2013, 602 is 15.1.2014)
  2014: ~55  ; ~600 - 65x (650 is 16.12.2014, 655 is 19.1.2015)
  2015: ~90  ; ~655 - ~745 (744 is 28.12.2015, 747 is 7.1.2016)
  2016: ~75  ; ~745 - 81x (812 is 3.12.2016, 828 is 19.1.2017)
  2017: ~75  ; ~820 - 89x (894 is 23.12.2018, 897 is 8.1.2018)
  2018: ~55  ; ~895 - (949 is 16.12.2018)

  (Similar for last modified)

-->  don't discuss them!

* Discuss peak in filter hits -- well, not particularly exciting, but it's an explanation
* Code? - no disc medium
* Next meetings? - Monday!
