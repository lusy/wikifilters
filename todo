# Next steps

* an idea for the presi/written text: begin and end every part (section/paragraph) with a question: what question do I want to answer here? what question is still open?
* How many of the edit filter managers also run bots. How do they decide in which case to implement a bot and in which a filter?
* Why are there mechanisms triggered before an edit gets published (such as edit filters), and such triggered afterwards (such as bots)? Is there a qualitative difference?
* do bots check also entire article text and not only single edits? as a clever person with malicious intentions I could split my malicious stuff into several edits to make it more difficult to discover -- unklar. ich hab das gefühl, die sind schon edit-basiert
* how stable is the edit filter managers group? how often are new editors accepted? (who/how nominates them? maybe there aren't very many accepted, but then again if only 2 apply and both are granted the right, can you then claim it's exclusive?) -- I think it's somewhat stable. In the last 3 months nothing has changed; for instance, mid-end 2017 there was somewhat high traffic of people requesting edit-filter-helper permissions, since it was newly implemented around that time (before that you could only get the full edit filter manager or nothing at all); it also seems that since then the practice was established that people would request edit filter helper first and only then be perhaps promoted to edit filter manager


* I want to help people to do their work better using a technical system (e.g. the edit filters). How can I do this?
* The edit filter system can be embedded in the vandalism prevention frame. Are there other contexts/frames for which it is relevant?

* look at AbuseFilter extention code: how is a filter trigger logged?
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-AbuseFilter/blob/master/includes/AbuseFilter.php

* understand how are stats generated
  * research filter development over time
    * plot number of filters over time (maybe grouped by week instead of a year)
    * get a feeling of the actions the filters triggered over time

  * ping aaron/amir for access to a backend db to look at filters; explanation how this is helping the community is important

* questions from EN-state-of-the-art
"Non-admins in good standing who wish to review a proposed but hidden filter may message the mailing list for details."
// what is "good standing"?
// what are the arguments for hiding a filter? --> particularly obnoxious vandals can see how their edits are being filtered and circumvent them; (no written quote yet)
// are users still informed if their edit triggers a hidden filter?
Exemptions for "urgent situation" -- what/how are these defined?
Discussions may happen postfactum here and filter may be applied before having been thoroughly tested; in this case the corresponding editor is responsible for checking the logs regularly and making sure the filter acts as desired
"Because even the smallest mistake in editing a filter can disrupt the encyclopedia, only editors who have the required good judgment and technical proficiency are permitted to configure filters."
--> Who are these editors? Who decides they are qualified enough?

## Questions

* weiß nicht wie relevant das ist, aber: wie funktionieren die gesichteten Versionen bei der Deutschen Wikipedia

# Questions to be asked to edit filter editors

* When did you join the edit filter group?
* How? (What was the process for joining)?
* Why?
* How active were you/what have you been doing since joining?
* What is an example of a typical case for which you will implement a filter?
* What is an example for a case you'd rather not implement a filter for but apply another process? Which process?
* Why does the edit filter mechanism exist? Aren't bots and ORES and semi-automatic tools such as Huggle or Twinkle enough for combating vandalism?

# Done

* Setup CSCW latex template up
* add "af_deleted" column to filter list

* Look at filters: what different types of filters are there? how do we classify them?
  * add a special tag for filters targeting spam bots? (!!! important: do research on distinction/collaboration bots/filters)
  * consider all types of vandalism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types_of_vandalism) when refining the self assigned tags
  (Abuse of tags; Account creation, malicious; Avoidant vandalism; Blanking, illegitimate; Copyrighted material, repeated uploading of; Edit summary vandalism; Format vandalism; Gaming the system; Hidden vandalism; Hoaxing vandalism; Image vandalism; Link vandalism; Page creation, illegitimate; Page lengthening; Page-move vandalism; Silly vandalism; Sneaky vandalism; Spam external linking; Stockbroking vandalism; talk page vandalism; Template vandalism; User and user talk page vandalism; Vandalbots;)
  * consider also other forms of (unintenionally) disruptive behaviour: boldly editing; copyright violation disruptive editing or stubbornness --> edit warring; edit summary omission; editing tests by experimenting users; harassment or personal attacks; Incorrect wiki markup and style; lack of understanding of the purpose of wikipedia; misinformation, accidental; NPOV contraventions (Neutral point of view); nonsense, accidental; Policy and guideline pages, good-faith changes to; Reversion or removal of unencyclopedic material, or of edits covered under the biographies of living persons policy; Deletion nominations;
  -----
  * classify in "vandalism"|"good_faith"|"biased_edits"|"misc" for now
  * syntactic vs semantic vs ? (ALL CAPS is syntactic)
  * are there ontologies?
  * how is spam classified for example?

* add a README to github repo

// do the users notice the logging? or only "bigger" actions such as warnings/being blocked, etc.?

  * look for db dumps

  * create a developer account

Do smth with this info:
Claudia: * A focus on the Good faith policies/guidelines is a historical development. After the huge surge in edits Wikipedia experienced starting 2005 the community needed a means to handle these (and the proportional amount of vandalism). They opted for automatisation. Automated system branded a lot of good faith edits as vandalism, which drove new comers away. A policy focus on good faith is part of the intentions to fix this.
* We need a description of the technical workings of the edit filter system!
* How can we improve it from a computer scientist's/engineer's perspective?
* What task do the edit filters try to solve? Why does this task exist?/Why is it important?

* Think about: what's the computer science take on the field? How can we design a "better"/more efficient/more user friendly system? A system that reflects particular values (vgl Code 2.0, Chapter 3, p.34)?
  * go over notes in the filter classification and think about interesting controversies, things that attract the attention
  * what are useful categories
  * GT is good for tackling controversial questions: e.g. are filters with disallow action a too severe interference with the editing process that has way too much negative consequences? (e.g. driving away new comers?)
* What can we study?
  * Discussions on filter patterns? On filter repercussions?
  * Whether filters work the desired way/help for a smoother Wikipedia service or is it a lot of work to maintain them and the usefullness is questionable?
  * Question: Is it worth it to use a filter which has many side effects?
  * What can we filter with a REGEX? And what not? Are regexes the suitable technology for the means the community is trying to achieve?

* What other data sources can I explore?
  * Interview with filter managers? with admins? with new editors?

* check filter rules for edits in user/talks name spaces (may be indication of filtering harassment)

* There was the section of what are filters suitable for; should we check filters against this list?
* add also "af_enabled" column to filter list; could be that the high hit count was made by false positives, which will have led to disabling the filter (TODO: that's a very interesting question actually; how do we know the high number of hits were actually leggit problems the filter wanted to catch and no false positives?)

# Feedback T

* gibts es vergleichbare concerns zu den Gamification concerns bei semi-automated tools bei anderen mechanismen?
* den Unterschied hervorheben: bots/semi-aut. tool: similar: automatic detection of potential vandalism; different: a person must click (in the tools)
* filters: BEFORE an edit is published; everything else: AFTER
* filters: REGEX!
* die wichtigsten erkenntnisse mehrmals erwähnen: intro, schluss, tralala; nicht dass sie unter gehen weil ich von lautern Bäumen den Wald nicht mehr sehe
* do bots check also entire article text and not only single edits? as a clever person with malicious intentions I could split my malicious stuff into several edits to make it more difficult to discover -- unklar. ich hab das gefühl, die sind schon edit-basiert
