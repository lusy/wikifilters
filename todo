# Next steps

* Look at filters: what different types of filters are there? how do we classify them?
  * add a special tag for filters targeting spam bots? (!!! important: do research on distinction/collaboration bots/filters)
  * consider all types of vandalism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types_of_vandalism) when refining the self assigned tags
  (Abuse of tags; Account creation, malicious; Avoidant vandalism; Blanking, illegitimate; Copyrighted material, repeated uploading of; Edit summary vandalism; Format vandalism; Gaming the system; Hidden vandalism; Hoaxing vandalism; Image vandalism; Link vandalism; Page creation, illegitimate; Page lengthening; Page-move vandalism; Silly vandalism; Sneaky vandalism; Spam external linking; Stockbroking vandalism; talk page vandalism; Template vandalism; User and user talk page vandalism; Vandalbots;)
  * consider also other forms of (unintenionally) disruptive behaviour: boldly editing; copyright violation disruptive editing or stubbornness --> edit warring; edit summary omission; editing tests by experimenting users; harassment or personal attacks; Incorrect wiki markup and style; lack of understanding of the purpose of wikipedia; misinformation, accidental; NPOV contraventions (Neutral point of view); nonsense, accidental; Policy and guideline pages, good-faith changes to; Reversion or removal of unencyclopedic material, or of edits covered under the biographies of living persons policy; Deletion nominations;
  -----
  * classify in "vandalism"|"good_faith"|"biased_edits"|"misc" for now
  * syntactic vs semantic vs ? (ALL CAPS is syntactic)
  * are there ontologies?
  * how is spam classified for example?

* check filter rules for edits in user/talks name spaces (may be indication of filtering harassment)
* add also "af_enabled" column to filter list; could be that the high hit count was made by false positives, which will have led to disabling the filter (TODO: that's a very interesting question actually; how do we know the high number of hits were actually leggit problems the filter wanted to catch and no false positives?)

* add a README to github repo

* Read these two pages

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Purpose

* look at AbuseFilter extention code: how is a filter trigger logged?
https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-AbuseFilter/blob/master/includes/AbuseFilter.php

* understand how are stats generated
  * research filter development over time
    * plot number of filters over time (maybe grouped by week instead of a year)
    * get a feeling of the actions the filters triggered over time

  * look for db dumps
  https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Quarry

  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page

  * create a developer account
  * ping aaron/amir for access to a backend db to look at filters; explanation how this is helping the community is important

* questions from EN-state-of-the-art
// do the users notice the logging? or only "bigger" actions such as warnings/being blocked, etc.?
"Non-admins in good standing who wish to review a proposed but hidden filter may message the mailing list for details."
// what is "good standing"?
// what are the arguments for hiding a filter? --> particularly obnoxious vandals can see how their edits are being filtered and circumvent them; (no written quote yet)
// are users still informed if their edit triggers a hidden filter?
Exemptions for "urgent situation" -- what/how are these defined?
Discussions may happen postfactum here and filter may be applied before having been thoroughly tested; in this case the corresponding editor is responsible for checking the logs regularly and making sure the filter acts as desired
"Because even the smallest mistake in editing a filter can disrupt the encyclopedia, only editors who have the required good judgment and technical proficiency are permitted to configure filters."
--> Who are these editors? Who decides they are qualified enough?
