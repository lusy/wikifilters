\section{Introduction}

\section{Genesis}

When and why were Wikipedia edit filters introduced?

\section{What is an edit filter}

Example of a filter
Difference bot/filter

\section{Edit filter governance}

* who can propose a filter?
* who can introduce a new filter?
* what happens in case of false positives

\section{Technical layer}

\subsection{The edit filter mediawiki extention}

\section{Edit filters on the English Wikipedia: State of the art}

* how many filters are there (were there over the years)
* what do the most active filters do?
* get a sense of what gets filtered (more qualitative)
* has the willingness of the community to use filters increased over time?
looking at aggregated values of number of triggered filters per year, the answer is rather it's quite constant
* how often were (which) filters triggered
* percentage of triggered filters/all edits
  * break down triggered filters according to typology
* percentage filters of different types over the years

\section{Critical discussion}

* why get certain filters (and not others?)

\section{Conclusion}

It is important that you write for the SIGCHI audience. Please read
previous years' proceedings to understand the writing style and
conventions that successful authors have used. It is particularly
important that you state clearly what you have done, not merely what
you plan to do, and explain how your work is different from previously
published work, i.e., the unique contribution that your work makes to
the field. Please consider what the reader will learn from your
submission, and how they will find your work useful. If you write with
these questions in mind, your work is more likely to be successful,
both in being accepted into the conference, and in influencing the
work of our field.

% Balancing columns in a ref list is a bit of a pain because you
% either use a hack like flushend or balance, or manually insert
% a column break.  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=balance
% multicols doesn't work because we're already in two-column mode,
% and flushend isn't awesome, so I choose balance.  See this
% for more info: http://cs.brown.edu/system/software/latex/doc/balance.pdf
%
% Note that in a perfect world balance wants to be in the first
% column of the last page.
%
% If balance doesn't work for you, you can remove that and
% hard-code a column break into the bbl file right before you
% submit:
%
% http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2149854/how-to-manually-equalize-columns-
% in-an-ieee-paper-if-using-bibtex
%
% Or, just remove \balance and give up on balancing the last page.
