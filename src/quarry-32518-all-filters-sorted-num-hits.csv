Appears to get more and better hits on referenced info now too. Apparently, previous version wasn't working properly. --Mgm

Switched on. - It Is Me Here
Tagging instead of disallowing, there are plenty of good reasons to remove references. -- Mgm
Oh, is this for all references? Wasn't there one regarding removing a {{Reflist}} template? - It Is Me Here
   That one (filter 79) was a test, and it doesn't appear to be working properly. It hasn't caught anything for at least 24 hours. - Mgm
removed private flag, unnecessary --  Zzuuzz
Updated format that should also catch named references and avoid the old reference grouping tag. --Mgm
Filter 79 now working properly, removing line that specifies reflist. Working on better regex to avoid <references/> being hit with this one --Mgm

Changing to edit_delta <= -1000 from >= -1000; seems like this was the intent. >= and <= comparisons are based on actual value, not absolute value. Correct me if this was the intent. Also, we are getting some false positives on this, see http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Interstate_5_in_Washington&diff=279452062&oldid=278504317 - Hersfold

>= is correct. It is supposed to exclude large removals from being evaluated since they're covered by blanking filters.  It was an error in the regex. Instead of allowing for <ref name=""whatever"">, the regex allowed choosing between <ref> and <ref name>, the last of which obviously didn't work. -- Mgm

added note in filter to avoid confusion --Mgm

Altered regex to treat refs as whole blocks, to avoid situation where a duplicate ref is changed to a named ref (<ref>Blah</ref> --> <ref name=foo/>).  Now won't catch users removing one end of a ref though.  Might have ec'd with cmt above, but can't tell in this wierd system :D --HM


Okay... I THINK this is finally a correct regex that:

  1) grabs <ref> ... </ref> as entire blocks
  2) grabs <ref name=""foo""/>
  3) ignores <references/>
  4) allows newline breaks between <ref> and </ref> tags.
  5) grabs only consecutive <ref>, </ref> pairs (as opposed to jumping from the first <ref> to the last </ref>).

From Coppertwig:
A more exact count might be obtained by defining a ref-opening as either ""<ref>"" or ""<ref name"" and a ref-closing as either ""</ref>"" or ""ref name ... />"".  (With the named reference, the same tag will sometimes count as both an opening and a closing.)  The code might look something like this (assuming rcount expects regular expressions):

/* count of removed ref-openings exceeds count of added ref-openings, or count of removed ref-closings exceeds count of added ref-closings; named refs with slashes count as both openings and closings. */ & (rcount(""(<ref>|<ref\sname)"",removed_lines) > rcount(""(<ref>|<ref\sname)"",added_lines) | rcount(""(</ref>|<ref\sname[^>/]*/>)"",removed_lines) > rcount(""(</ref>|<ref\sname[^>/]*/>)"",added_lines)

Boldly adding a warning. The rationale behind this is as follows:
~ Filter works, triggered only when a large amount (400+ bytes) of sourced content is removed
~ This does not prevent save nor deter the removal of the content, it simply politely asks the user to use an edit summary
~ Under standard practice patrollers would revert unexplained removal of sourced content anyway
~ Most hits appear to be blatant vandalism

Following this logic, this filter should serve well. For the good editors, it teaches to use an edit summary when removing content. The patrollers would revert and ask them to do the same, instead the filter is doing that job. For the bad editors, the fact that they have to hit save twice alone will help prevent vandalism.

If someone has an issue with this filter or feels there should not be a warning, feel free to remove warning, but please let me know, and consider starting a thread at [[Wikipedia talk:Edit filter]] explaining why you think this is a bad idea. Please also keep the filter enabled. Thank you!

Could it be changed to prevent the creation of ""Aaron Blakk""? - \ /

First, why did you undo my last edit here?  Second, why would you want to prevent the creation of user names that HELP us detect him?  The user names themselves are not offensive, the edits are. - Wknight94

It was my first edit to the AF, must've inadvertantly done it - sorry. I see your point in re to that, it was only if we were blocking one we may as well block another. - \ /

Okay, no problem on the inadvertent undo.  Right, I don't think we should be preventing any user name creation.  Like my earlier edit used to say, user name prevention is only when THE USER NAME ITSELF is offensive.  In this case, they're not.  That eliminated the first part of this filter.  The second part is catching general vandalism that should be handled in one of the general vandalism filters, and was catching more non-GT than GT.  That makes this filter mostly pointless so I had disabled entirely.  - Wknight94

You know, I've actually found this filter to be quite useful, even if much of it is non-GT. There is almost no good reason to add obscenities in all caps. Currently we don't have a filter that checks for this and disallows the action. - KoH

If it doesn't catch false positives, leave it running.  For supportability, it should probably be merged into 52 though.  (I changed the name here to reflect actual usage). - Wknight94

No, it's different. This checks not only for edit summaries, but also added content. (A more descriptive title would be ""Adding obscenities in all caps,"" but that would be too obvious. If a vandal saw that in the log, they would know to put the obscenity in lowercase letters.) - KoH

To enable filtering for very short posts of 10 characters or less, we have now made a change to the Abuse filter extension to increase the threshold that disables filters if they exceed  5% of total actions, raising it to 10% (but only for filters that are in the feedback group, leaving other filters untouched).  To test that this change is working as intended, I will start by disallowing posts with 10 characters or less. If that works and the filter is not disabled, then it means that our change did the job. If the filter is disabled at 10 characters, then I will go down to 9 characters or less, then 8 characters or less, until we reach a stable state. Fingers crossed .... -- Fabrice Florin Oct. 26, 2012

:I disabled warn, the rule seems remarkably correct, but it will start catching some stuff which is not an email address, but still looks like it (http://a.b.c/something@blah.hmt is a valid URL, absolutely not an email address, e.g. another example can be some computer-address data).  Furthermore, there is legit data that looks like an email address and there are legit places to add email addresses (userspace being one of them).  Also, the brackets '(' and ')' don't do anything but catch the data contained in it.  A better regex is '(?<![^\s:])[^\s\]\[\{\}\\\|^\/`<>@:]+@\w+(?!\.htm)(?:\.\w+){1,3}' .. but even that one that is NOT failsave (though I have until now only seen (!) one mistaken revert by XLinkBot on that rule).

Also, irlike is case insensitive, but here we don't need regex anyway, so let's use ""in"", etc., along with lcase.

As the most highly visible page on Wikipedia, the Main Page has historically been one of the first vandalism targets of a compromised account. Thus, admins are generally cautioned to be careful when editing the Main Page because any edit that resembles vandalism might be perceived as one made by a compromised sysop account (see also [[Template:Editnotices/Main Page]]).

Disabled for now until an appropriate warning message is created, and there is actually enough activity to warrant such a filter. -- Zzyzx11

Enough activity? The history tab says it hasn't been edited in a month and a half! A software workaround should be much better in terms of performance. And it's not like we're having a lot of compromised sysop accounts... --Admiral Norton

Maybe not immediately recent. It appears from your user contributions, Admiral Norton, that you were not around during April-May 2007 when at least five sysop accounts were compromised and attacked the Main Page in less than two weeks (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2007-05-07/Admins desysopped]]). I was thinking about that when creating this filter. It would be nice to have something like a warning just in case. But since it only covers one page, you may be right that using Abuse Filter might have some performance issues. -- Zzyzx11

Even then, though, a compromised account won't stop just because a big ugly box tells them to. Even if they do, they'll just find some other (more difficult to reverse) means of wreaking havoc with the admin tools. Maybe throw up an editnotice (and I think there already is one...?) but an abuse filter isn't necessary and risks slowing things down. - Hersfold

This filter is intended to be set to block this addition except for experienced editors (at which moment the filter can be disabled, though I doubt that there is a reliable source for this, this is more likely to be a hoax).

Some cleanup. user_editcount is blank for unregistered users, so you can < to account for it and registered users. If we only want to target the article ""St. Bernard (dog)"" (and not the talk page), I would use article_articleid. I also made some aesthetic changes, hope you don't mind :) ~MA
